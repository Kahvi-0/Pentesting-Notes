# Information gathering 

##Find owner, IP addr, and emails

WHOIS http://whois.domaintools.com/

DNS
it with the discovered IPs or the IPs we are given to test
This will help us gather all IPs related to a domain or sub domain.

   nslookup -querytype=ANY <domain, sub-domain, or IP>

Finding targets ISP

Sometimes target may rely on ISP and hosting companies as they may not be the owners of their IP addresses.

 note: When the org is big, Net-blocks may be assigned to it , so no hosting services are involved. 
 A corp is not limited to having only one hosting company.

## Infrastructure

Web server fingerprinting 

  HTTP response headers
  netcraft can reveal info on this sometimes
  netcat
    nc <IP> 80
    The response headers should be inspected
    
  httprint
  whatweb
    reconizes website tech, web server versions, blog platforms, JS libraries, and more
    whatweb -v <domain>
  wappalyzer
  

Fingerprint webserver modules 

  Note: url rewriting is taking parameters like  id=100 and the webserver will use a regex rule to match the rewrite rule to translate the ID to a webpage then pass it on.
  done with .htaccess in atache with mod_rewrite and IIS uses Ionic Isap rewrite or Helicon isapi rewrite

  Not having the real URL and only the rewritten URL can make it much more difficuly for a pen test to attack the URLs, however still possible by using other channels such as forms, cookies, and headers.
  
  ugly URLS= /test?id=1100
  searchengine friendly = /test/login.php
  
  Note: input from forms are still intact for you to tamper with
  
  hard to RE rewritting rules
