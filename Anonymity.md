# Anonymity

- Browsing Anonymously

  Note: as you send traffic threouigh another device, they can sniff this. So use extreme caution and do not sue systems that you do not own or that you do not know what information they capture. Also make sure the client is well aware of the type of testing you are doing and if this is needed or not.
  
## HTTP proxies: Proxy: Basically asking another system to do something on your behalf. 
       - Common is HTTP or SOCKS proxy. These can be chained to help obfuscate the original IP.
       - List of proxies: https://hidemy.name/en/proxy-list/
       - Proxy sub types: 
           - High anonymous (elite): Do not change req fields and look like they came from a real IP. No indication to the web srv that the req is coming form a proxy.
           - Anonymous: Do not show your real IP, do change the req fields. As a result are able to tell its a proxy server from web logs. Some admins block proxy requests this way. 
           - Transparent(HTTP relay): change the req fields and transfer the real IP of the user. These offer no security and should never be used for security testing. Only reason for use would be for network speed improvments. 
           
       - Make sure to select reliable proxies, preferably ones you own, oe else you risk exposing your customers data to an unkown entity which you can be held liable. 

### How to check for real anonymous proxies

  - Research the service FULLY (A thief is never going to tell you they are robbing you). 
  
  - Verify anonymity settings by using the service and visitng a site you own to check logs.  
  
  - Popular anonymity testing sites:

    Proxy signs: 
      
       Headers used by proxies to show the server tht is acting on behalf of another systems: 
          HTTP_VIA   #Addresses (including chained) indicate the proxies being used. The IP in this field is the IP of the proxy.
          HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR  #indicates the actual IP of the clien that the proxy is acting on behalf for the comms

## TOR network

  - Cleints req a list of TOR nodes from a dir server
  - Client rand slects nodes (relays). encrypts traffic between each relay. 
  - If the client req a second dest after the specified time limit, a sperate tunnel is created for that comm. 
  
  - Only works for TCP strams and can be used by any app with SOCKS support.
  - Recommended you use protocol specific software if you do not wante the sites you visit to see your ID info 


- Tunneling for Anonymity

Protect the traffic either an entity or proxy with secure protocols and encryption. This will create a seure tunnel between you and the proxy system (or entity) that cannot be easily read.

- many types of tunnelling tech, two are very effective: SSH and IPSEC VPNs.
