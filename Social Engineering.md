Common types:

- Pretexting: Placing a person in a realistic but fake situation, in order to get them to divulge info. an example of this would be to impersonate a help desk employee and assiting another target employee with either a data move or software update. This software that you give them would be malware which you have tricked them into running. Pretexting typically requires a great deal of planning and research to pull off.

- Phishing: Uses fraudulanet email, in order to coerce people into executing malicious code or revealing pertinent information. 

- Baiting: Takes advantage of human curiosity. Leaving media devices such as CDs, DVD, or USB stick in a conspicious locations, relysing on the human factor of curiosity of a passerby to pick it up and take a look at its contents. 

- Physical: Try to gain physical access to the target facility or restricted area. Often done by either piggybacking or shadowing a person into an entrance. They may wear a fake badge in order to both trick the person they are following and if they loose the person they followed in, be more convincing to other staff.
