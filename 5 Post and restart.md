# POST Exploitation

Final technical step before the reporting phase. 


The activities are not always the same depending on the level of access, what system you compromised, how stealthy you need to be, etc. 


As always, remember the ROE. make sure you have permissions and the rights to modify servics, machine configs, escalate privs,  gather sensitive info, delete logs, etc. Even if the ROE permits deletion or edits, back them up beforehand.

As always log everything you do and when. 

All data collected must be protected, the pentest machine must be encrypted and permanently delete it once the pentest is completed. As well as when reporting sensitive data to the client.



## Post exploitation methodology (Cyclic process)

1. Priv escalation and persistence (Implement some auth so others cannot use it).

   Priv esc: - Vertical: move from lower priv to a higher priv 
             - Horizontal: move to an another account that has equal privs.
             
    In this phase we want our session:
    
      - to be stable (does not get dropped)
        - Exploiting a brower vuln would mean our shell was tied to that browser session. If the end user closes it, the shell closes. 
        - Need to migrate to another process. 
        - Can only migrate to a process wit hthe same priv as the current session.
      - privileged
      - persistent (through reboots). 
        - Most of the time will require priv acccess.

2. Data harvesting.

3. Internal network scan.

4. Exploitation of new systems and pivoting.
