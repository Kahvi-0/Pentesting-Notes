# Footprinting and Scanning

Goal: Deepin the knowledge of the in-scope servers and services. Fingerprinting. Want to find the OS, purpose of the IP, importance host has to the client. Map the network environment.

 **Network mapping:**
  ping sweep for live assets:
  
      nmap –sn <target>
        
        target can be a NET/CIDR or "–iL hostslist.txt" to invoke using a list of ranges
        
  Note that some networks block ping / do not allow certain servers to respond to ping, therefore this should not be the only way to determine live hosts.
  
  Then you will want top discover the OS running on each node and chart the OS detected from nmap and its confidence and apply your own judgement. 
  
   Active OS fingerprinting with nmap
   
      nmap -Pn –O <targets>
      
        -O: Enable OS detection
        --osscan-limit: Limit OS detection to promising targets
        --osscan-guess: Guess OS more aggressively
   
   Offline passive OS fingerprinting can be done with [P0f](http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/p0f3/)
    
  ## Port scanning to find what daemons and services are running on each node
     - NMAP
     - Masscan
     - Metasploit scan
     
  ## Service enumeration

  ## Finding vulnerabilities
    - Nessus
    - NMAP Vuln scripts
    
     
  ## Finding explouts 
  
    - Serachsploit
