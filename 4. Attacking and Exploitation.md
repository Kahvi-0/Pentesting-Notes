# Manual exploitation vs automated tools

  ### Manual
  
  - Finding exploits:
    - Exploitdb (listed from nmap exploidb vuln scan)
    - google
    
    Always a good idea to get a high level idea of what the exploit does.
  
  ### Automated
  
  - Metasploit - contains exploits


  - on a pentest, being loud may not be a bad thing. So brute forcing for weak passwords should be okay.
  
 
 ### Authentication attack notes

    #Ask/use test account to find out how many failed logins lock out for whatever login page you are attempting to attack
 
  - Bruteforcing / attacking weak credentails
     - Use user and/or pass wordlists to try and break into an existing account.
  
  - Password spray
    - Using known username with out known password.
  
  - Credential stuffing
    - Using breached credentials with the hopes that the user reuses their passwords.
      - these can be found by looking at OSINT for employees then researching if company email was involved in breaches
