# Enumeration

Goal: Gather more detailed info on both devices and resources attached to the network. For example: account anmes, shares, misconfigured services, etc.

Like the scanning phase, this phase involves active connections to remote devices in the network. 


Examples of protocols that can be exploited if admins dont take steps to secure of disable them. 

## NETBIOS (Network Basic Input Output System) is the service that allows Windows systems to share files, folders, and printers amoung machines on a LAN. 
 If not config'd it can leak a lot of info, such as shares, system info, user IDs, more.  
 
 - [NetBIOS history](https://github.com/Kahvi-0/General-Notes/blob/master/Networking/NetBIOS.md)
 
 - How NetBIOS and NetBIOS over TCP (NBT) work: Main purpose is to allow apps on diff systems communicate with one another over the LAN. Used for sharing printers and files, remote procedure calls (RPC), exchange messages, etc. All of which may reveal info. 
 
 Use ports: UDP 137 name services, UDP 138 for datagram services, and TCP 139 for session services.

 **[Name service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2003/cc738412(v=ws.10)?redirectedfrom=MSDN)** Same purpose of a DNS record, translates and maps a NetBIOS name to an IP. Name = 16-byte address that IDs a NetBIOS resource on the network and ius dynamically registered when either services or apps start. Names can be registered as unique names or as group names. To locate a resource, a NBT name query is used to resolve the NBT name to an IP addr. The 16 characters of a name: first 15 can be specified by the user which the 16th is used to indicate the resource type (00 to FF).
 Some that are available:

 nbtstat -n can show the NetBIOS names on our machine. 
 
 The service that maps NetBIOS names to IP is WINS (Windows Internal Name Service). 
 
 **NetBIOS Datagram Services ** permits the sending of datagram messages to and from a NetBIOS name and broadcast the datagram to all NetBIOS names. The datagram and broadcast methods allow one computer to comm with several other computers at the same time, however are limited in message size. No error detection/ correction using datagram or broadcast methods, however datagram comm allows comm without need for a session to be est. 
 
  **Net BIOS Session Service (NBSS)** Allows two names to est a connection in order to exchange data. For example, when a device creates a file sharing connection the session service is used. Once the session has been est, the two workstation use the SMB. 
  
  
 
 
## SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) used to gather info and config devies (printers, switches, servers, etc).
