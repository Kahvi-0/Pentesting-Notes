**Information to collect:**

- Doamins
- Netblocks or IP addresses
- Mail servers
- ISP's used
- Any other technical information

- Keep in mind that discovered info may be out of scope seen is the SoE (Scope of Engagement).

The following will outline how to collect info in a similar situation as a real malicious actor. Starting with just the ORG name and the ORG website.

## Domains

**whois**

- https://who.is/whois/

CLI: 

     whois <domain>
     
      Whois will try to guess the right whois server to contact, if that fails it will as whoissolutions.com or whois.arin.net for the IP address and hostname. 
      May tell you the registers whois server. You can query that server specifically with -h
     
       - h force a whois server
       
     

 Public database. 
 
Search for target with no domain. then continue with other variations of TLDs and other in scope domains found.
 
 Information:
 
 - Owner of domain name
 - IP address (NETs) or range
 - Autonomous Systems Numbers (ASNs)
 - Technical contacts
 - Expiration data of the domain
 - Number of Resource Records
 - Organization records (ORGs)
 - Point of Contact records (POCs)
 - Authoritatice information for ASNs and registered outside of the RIR being queried.
 - DNS servers ( remember that some may not be inscope)
 - Physical location (may be owned by the RIR and not target)
 
 - Note: WHOIS typically runs on port 43.
 - Note: RIR is not responsible for hte info in the database they maintain. That is up to the individual ORGs. 

*RIR (Regional Internet Registry)*

ORG that manages resources such as IP addresses and Autonomous Systems for a specific region. 
There are five main RIR providers for WHOIS info:

- AFRINIC
- ARIN
- LACNIC
- RIPE NCC
