## DNS

Domain Name System (DNS) is a distributed database arranged hierarchically. Purpose to provide an IP for hostnames. 
Many protocols such as SSL are as safe as the DNS protocol they bind to. 




**Identify live hosts**

ICMP ping sweep: 

     fping -a -g IP/CIDR -r 0
     
      -a few ICMP echo request
        -A same but only those that are alive        
      -r  number of retries      
      -e returns response in MS
      -g subnets
      -q quiet, only see alive hosts

     nmap -sn IP/CIDR
     
      -sn - ping scan, then TCP SYN to port 443 and 80, then ICMP time stamp request. 
       note that unpriv users can only send SYN packets to port 443 and 80.
       note, if you run nmap scan from within the same network, it will actually run an ARP scan instead of ICMP packets.
        --disable-arp-ping or --send-ip to disable.
        
      -PS<port>  TCP SYN to specific port
      -PA  TCP ack
      -PU  UDP packet
      -PY  SCTPINIT packet dest port 80
      -PE  ICMP echo request
      -PM  ICMP mask request
      -PP  

     hping3 -1 <IP> -c 3
     
      -c number of requests
      -1 ICMP
      -2 UDP
      -S SNY packet
      -F send FIN packet
      -U send the URG flag
      -X xms (flags FIN, URG, PSH)
      
      subnets: 10.10.10.x --rand-dest (to repalce the x)
      
      -I eth0 

ICMP is to 100% reliable as it is common to disable it.



  



## Maltego

source intelligence and forensics app. 

Uses what it calls transforms to discover info about targets. you can start with a server address and enumerate various info about that server then build on that info until you have a full map of the entities entire internet presence.

Machines: maltego programs / scripts that allow us to extract info from internet 

Transforms:  programs / scripts queries that we can enumerate and gather info about a specific object 

Note that some machines are noisier than others. 

**Starting from blank machine (i.e click new at the top left)**

Palelt of the right -> choose where to start investigation. 

drag the object to the black space -> double click it to change the details 

right clicking it will show the transforms
