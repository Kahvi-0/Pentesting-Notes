OSINT or passive is gatheriung as much info about a target (network, system, etc) without exposing your presence.

The type of information that will be collected will mostly include business information like web domains, physical locations, employees / departments, emails, partners and third parties, press & news releases, Documents, Financial info, job postings. But you may be able to also find infrastructure related info.


It is a good idea to keep track of this information in a mind mapping tool such as [xmind](https://www.xmind.net/)

have the company in the center and add OSINT data to the edges (i.e employees, business, projects, websites, locations)
