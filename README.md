### Reconnaissance

  - Active
  
  - Passive
    - Does not touch target systems. I.e target should have no indication/proof (logs or other) that we are looking into them
    - OSINT
  
### Scanning and Enumeration 

  - Port scanning
     - Finding open ports
     
  - Service enumeration
     - Web https://github.com/Kahvi-0/Cheat-Sheets/blob/master/Web.md
     - SSH https://github.com/Kahvi-0/Vulnerabilities-and-Exploitations/blob/master/Network/SSH.md
     - SMB https://github.com/Kahvi-0/Vulnerabilities-and-Exploitations/blob/master/Network/SMB.md
  
  - Finding vulnerabilities
    - Nessus
    - NMAP Vuln scripts


### ATTACK

  - Gaining Access
    
    
### Persistance

  - How to keep access to that device for later use. 
  - After device has been rebooted

### Covering tracks
